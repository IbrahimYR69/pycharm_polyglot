# Polyglot Python with PyCharm Professional

> #### info::This series is a work-in-progress.

If you're a long-time Python web developer, you are used to web
technologies: HTML, CSS, a little JavaScript. But modern frontend
web development might seem alien and un-Pythonic.

If so, this tutorial is aimed at you. These frontend ideas
are important, but you need a Python guide through the thicket. You
also need a tool that can support your Python *and* frontend development.
PyCharm, with the foundation it shares with WebStorm, is uniquely
suited for this.

In this tutorial we will introduce ideas and packages in isolation,
with hands-on code, screenshots, and more. Each article's code is
[in GitHub](https://github.com/pauleveritt/pauleveritt.github.io). You can
file bug reports in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/pauleveritt/pauleveritt.github.io/issues).
